\title{Data standardization}
\usage{
standardize_norm(X, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

standardize(X, scale = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{matrix}

\item{center}{centering by the mean}

\item{scale}{scaling by the standard deviation}
}
\description{
Perform data standardization for multivariate exploratory data analysis.
}
\details{
Standardization depends on what you need to perform factor analysis. We
implemented two types:
\itemize{
\item \code{standardize}: standardization is performed by centering the
data matrix and dividing by the square root of the sum of squares of the
weights. This is the default standardization in FactoMineR::PCA().
\item \code{standardize_norm}: standardization is performed by centering and scaling
the data matrix. (X - Âµ) / Ïƒ, where Âµ is the mean and Ïƒ is the standard deviation.
}
}
